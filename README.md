angular-delts
=============

Angularjs/Node.js implementation of the delt site

To get this working, run deltserver.js using Node, ie: 
node deltserver.js 

Then update the SERVER value in frontend/js/services/dataservice.js to wherever your node server is running.

Place or link the root directory to somewhere under your web root, and you should be able to see the site running locally.
